# ourspace
OurSpace is a web2py app developed by Ricardo Munoz, Michael Ha, Bijan Semnani, and myself as a final project for CMPS 183 at UCSC. It is a single page webapp that is home to two personalized fields.

There is a text area where a user can store any text and save it to a server for access at any time, anywhere. Additionally, there is a feature we call "folders". Folders will open your favorite group of links! Wow what an innovative feature! We estimate that folders can actually save a user about 30 minutes of time every 10 weeks (the length of one quarter at UCSC).

Additionally we implemented the Twilio API to send text messages to your phone! Put in your phone number in any format (I hope...let me know if something breaks) and can get sent a text message with the content of the text field or the listing of links in a folder.
